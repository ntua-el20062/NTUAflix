NTUA/ECE Software Engineering, 2023-2024

## Introduction

Welcome to the NTUAFlix application repository! This document provides a guide on setting up the repository locally on your computer and running the application. NTUAFlix is a movie streaming platform developed by the NTUA/ECE Software Engineering team for the academic year 2023-2024.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the repository, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- MySQL is installed and configured on your system.
- Python is installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the git repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone the git repository to your local machine using the command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ntua/softeng23-05
     ```
     
2. **Database Setup and Dependencies Installation**:
   - Run the `setup.py` file at the top-level directory of the repository to install dependencies, set up the database and initialize the application:
     ```
     python setup.py
     ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   - Navigate to the `front-end` folder and run the `server.py` file to start the server:
     ```
     cd front-end
     python server.py
     ```

4. **Running CLI Commands**:

   To run CLI commands in the correct format, follow these steps:
   
   1. Create a new file in Notepad.
   2. Paste the following contents into the file:
   
       ```batch
       @echo off
       python C:\temp\cli-client\se2305.py %*
       ```
   
   3. Save the file with the extension `.bat`.
   4. Move the saved file to the directory `C:/Windows/System32`.
   
   After completing these steps, you can execute CLI commands using the specified format: 

    $ se23XX scope --param1 value1 [--param2 value2 ...] --format fff

   Replace `se2305.py` with the appropriate filename if necessary, and ensure that the Python script is located in the specified directory.



4. **Access the Application**:
   - Once the server is running, you can access the NTUAFlix application at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your web browser.

## Additional Information

- The NTUAFlix application is built using Python and MySQL.
- The `setup.py` file installs the dependencies contained in the `dependencies.py` file, initializes the database and starts the API server.
- The `server.py` file in the `front-end` folder launches the front-end server.
- Ensure to have a stable internet connection during setup to download necessary dependencies.
- When running the application locally, its source code was located in the path C:\temp\new_folder\softeng23-05; however, this may vary depending on the folder used for local storage of the application.
